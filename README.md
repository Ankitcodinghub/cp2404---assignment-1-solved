Assignment Part 1 â€“ Conceptual Database Modelling

Assessment Weight: 20%

Rationale

This assignment has been designed to assess studentsâ€™ ability to model a database, by constructing an entity-relationship diagram for a particular business scenario. This assignment addresses the following learning objectives for this subject:

â€¢ Develop a database model using the entity-relationship model

â€¢ Apply the techniques of normalisation

Requirements (Tasks)

2) Based on the descriptions draw a fully labeled and implementable Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). Include all entities, relationships, optionalities, connectivities, cardinalities and constraints. You must use Crowâ€™s foot notation and MySQL Workbench (or other software) to create the ERD. A Hand-drawn ERD will NOT be accepted. A sample ERD can be found in Appendix A of this document. (Note: The ERD created using the drawing tool (e.g. MySQL Workbench) will need to be saved (or exported) as an image file and then be included in your document file to be submitted)

3) A summary to describe the major justifications, assumptions and limitations related to your database design. For example:

â€¢ Assumption/justifications for optionalitiy, connectivities, constraints data type and data domain; and

â€¢ Special cases or data integrity issues that cannot be handled.

Make sure that your final submission shows consistent design in ERD (Task 2).

Submission

â€¢ You need to submit a single document file (MS Word or PDF format) to LearnJCU.

The document should include all the answers for Task 1-3. Please name the file as LastnameFirstnameA1.doc or LastnameFirstnameA1.pdf.

â€¢ Timestamp shown on LearnJCU assignment submission will be used to determine if the assignment is late or not. Refer to the subject guide for the policy for late submission.

Business Description (Scenario)

As branch managers they need to manage staff schedules, collect tuition fees, and manage other daily activities including recruitment of new students.

Managers also gets commission for any new students who join their branch.

Each manager is expected to send a report to the head office in New York every quarter. This report summarizes the total revenues collected, the total expenses such as staff salary, materials purchased, food items for students etc. As TPS does not run an established database system, currently managers fill out a paper form and mail it back to head office. Many managers have complained that preparing this report is a very difficult and time-consuming process. Also, the managers at the head-office also have expressed concerns about the accuracy and verifiability of the reports.

To reduce these concerns and to improve the ease and efficiency with which the branch managers conduct their daily business, the company is proposing to develop a centralized database that can be used by the managers to track the daily business of their branch and to prepare their reports. You have been asked to design a database that satisfies general business description and various user requirements summarized above.

TPS also showed you some samples of various forms and reports to enhance your modeling job. The first example is of a spreadsheet to keep track of their staff details:

The second example is of a spreadsheet used to track students:

The third is an example of tracking subjects and teaching staff:

Subject Staff ID # Level Taught

Mathematics S110 Level 1-6

Science S120 Level 3-6

English S120 Level 1-6

The fourth is an example of tracking classroom allocation:

Classroom Day Time Subject Level

Finally, here is an example of the report that each branch manager must turn in to the main office quarterly. The sample below is from the Malaysia Branch office.

TPS Quarterly Report

Branch Location: Malaysia

1234 Kuala Lumpur,

Address: Malaysia

Quarter: 3

Manager In-Charge: XXX

Revenues

Total Fees Collected $ 60,000.00

Expenses

Utilities $ 6,000. 00

Maintenance $ 500.00

Stationery $ 2,000.00

Wages $ 39,000.00

Food Items $ 4,000.00

Other Expenses $ 1,000.00

Recreation $ 500.0 0

Total Expenses $ 53,000.00

Net Income/Loss $ 7,000.00

There are more business descriptions/requirements provided by TPS and they are summarized here:

â€“ New students who register must specify their preference for in-house subject tuition (Eg. English, Math, Science) and the level.

â€“ Each branch is paid a one-time 10% commission on new registered student based on their monthly fees.

â€“ Branches which achieves a minimum enrolled students (10) per month receives a monthly bonus of $1000.

â€“ Only 10 students per class per subject

â€“ Each branch can organize 2 outdoor activities per quarter. Activities ranges from educational tours, recreational activities, etc.

â€“ Each branch will allocate 3 staff in-charge to manage studentsâ€™ daily activities including classroom activities, schedules, monthly test and keep track of studentsâ€™ overall progress as well as reporting their progress to the parents/guardian (quarterly).

â€“ TPS also runs seminars and activities with some schools on a quarterly basis. This is managed by the branch manager, and this is a form of recruitment exercise where they share the type of activities, studentsâ€™ interactions and studentsâ€™ progress with teachers and parents.

â€“ For maintenance, the branches keep a list of local maintenance companies (e.g. electricians, plumbers, contractors) contracted to TPS and the branch manager selects one from the list to allocate a maintenance job. All maintenance records will be kept and reported to the head office (quarterly)

â€“ Each branch is equipped with a number of pre-installed equipment like fire alarms, air-conditioners, and some classes are equipped with laptops for studentsâ€™ access and learning. Details of each asset item is recorded and being managed. These asset items are inspected and maintenance periodically.

APPENDIX A ERD

(Note about the example ERD provided above:

â€“ You are not required to specify obvious cardinalities like (0,M), (1,1), (1,M) etc. You are required to specify

specific cardinalites which are not presented using crowâ€™s foot notation like (1,3), (4,10), (10,M) etc.

Note:

If you want to present the supertype-subtype relationships using an extended-ERD (EERD), you will need to draw the necessary EERD notations using facilities provided by the drawing tool software you use. Alternatively, you can present the supertype-subtype relationships using multiple 1:1 relationships having same PKs for all related entities and describe the special relationships in your document.
